Welcome to the FutuDraw example project repository! This repository demonstrates how to use FutuDraw with SvelteKit, a simple and fun drawing app that utilizes the FutuDraw API.

## What is FutuDraw?

FutuDraw is an easy-to-use drawing API that allows developers to integrate drawing functionalities into their web applications. With FutuDraw, you can create, save, and share drawings in your own applications. Whether you're building an educational tool, a collaborative project, or a creative platform, FutuDraw can add an interactive drawing component to enhance your application's user experience.

## Getting Started

To run this example project locally, you need to obtain an `app_id` and `api_key` from FutuDraw. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/futudraw-example.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd futudraw-example
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the required FutuDraw credentials:
```bash
VITE_FUTUDRAW_APP_ID="your_futudraw_app_id"
VITE_FUTUDRAW_API_KEY="your_futudraw_api_key"
```

Replace **_your_futudraw_app_id_** and **_your_futudraw_api_key_** with the credentials you obtained from FutuDraw.

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
